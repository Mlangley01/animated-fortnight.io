# [Insert Name]
# You are [name]. It is just turned 9 oclock and, after a long day at work, you have found yourself drifting off on the sofa. All of a sudden you are jolted awake by the sound of ringing. You fumble around the cushions looking for your phone, but don't get to it in time before the call cuts off. The phone screen shows no caller ID. You shrug it off, assuming it was somebody trying to sell you something.
# The phone rings again. What do you do?
# [Don't answer]
# You turn your phone on silent and switch on the TV. You never pick up your phone for withheld numbers, it's always robots trying to scam you. You spend the rest of the night watching a show about truck drivers working in dangerous conditions. Hey, it passes the time.
# Thank you for... not playing the game!
# [End.]
# [Answer phone]
# Confused as to why they rang back, you answer the phone. "Hello?" You hear your voice echo back to you on the other end. "....." No answer. "Listen if you're trying to sell me something then I'm not interested!" You say before hanging up.
# As soon as you press the red button on your phone screen you hear a loud, urgent banging on your front door. The noise makes you jump and nearly drop your phone. You stand up as the knocking gets louder.
# Nobody would call round at this time of night... What do you do?
# [Don't open]
# As you go to turn the latch and unlock the door a sense of dread suddenly washes over you. You're not sure why, but something in you is telling you not to answer the door. You turn away from the door as the phone begins to ring once again.
# [repeat 'answer phone' prompt]
# [Open the door]

# name=print_slow(input("What is your name?\n"))
# [Open the door]
# You turn the latch to the door and pull it open. There's nobody there, just a cardboard box on your doorstep. That's weird, you could've sworn the knocking stopped right as you turned the latch-
# You take a closer look at the box. It has a label that has "{name}, OPEN IN PRIVATE" in big red letters tied to it. You know you should be suspicious of a strange parcel dropped on your doorstep, but there's a niggling feeling in the back of your mind that makes your curiosity take over.
# You pick up the box and head back inside. Inside the box is a note and a photo of a house with an address scribbled on the back.

# Your mind is spinning with questions, but you can't help but feel drawn to the house in the photo. You're sure you've seen it before, the address isn't too far from where you grew up. You know deep down that this is all very suspicious, any sensible person would call the police. But....
# What do you do?
# [Call the police]
# You decide that some things just aren't worth it. This is probably just a prank, but it could be something way more dangerous. You pull your phone out and type in 999.
# Over the next couple of days the police come, ask you some questions and take the box and its contents as evidence. You explained to them that you don't know much, it just turned up on your doorstep one night. Nothing comes of the mysterious note and life carries on as normal, the events of that night eventually fading away into memory.
# Congratulations, you were sensible and lived a long, normal life with absolutely 0 paranormal activity!
# [End.]
# [Go to the house]
# You move without thinking and grab your coat and your keys. The drive doesn't take too long and you get to the address just before 10.
# From the looks of things the place is abandoned. The garden is overgrown and the windows are filthy. If anybody is stuck inside they definitely wouldn't be having a good time.
# As you approach the front of the house the front door swings open. The wind must've caught it, you think to yourself as you take a step inside.
# "Hello? Jack are you in here? It's {name}!"
# You shout from the doorstep, but there's no answer. With a deep breath you take a step inside.
# SLAM!
# The door behind you swings shut, pushing you into the hallway. You grab the handle and try to open the door, but it's stuck.
# You are now trapped inside the abandoned house. You make your way down the hall testing the doors to multiple rooms.
# Eventually one door opens and you find yourself in the kitchen. The inside is dimly lit and it's difficult to make out. In the middle of the room is a table, though you can't quite make out what is on top of it. In the corner of the room is a large cupboard that looks like it's used for storage. What would you like to do?
# [Search kitchen]
# You look around the kitchen. In the dim light you can't find much of use, however a glint on the table grabs your attention. You find a large kitchen knife. This should come in handy if you come across anything dangerous.
# [loop back to "What would you like to do?"
# [Inspect cupboard(no knife)]
# You head over to the cupboard. The door rattles slightly as you approach. You reach out and open it.
# Inside the cupboard is the shape of a man, tall and hunched over to fit in the confines of the space. He slowly turns to face you and your stomach drops.
# His face is gaunt and his skin looks thin and stretched too tight across his skull. Where his eyes should be are dark, empty pits.
# The man opens his mouth, lets out a screech and rushes towards you. In a panic you stumble back and fall onto the table.
# You feel a sharp pain in your back, and look down. You must not have seen the large knife lying on the table.
# Your vision fades, the last thing you see is the man standing over you, his feet levitating above the ground.
# [End.]
# [Inspect cupboard(with knife)]
# You head over to the cupboard. The door rattles slightly as you approach. You reach out and open it.
# Inside the cupboard is the shape of a man, tall and hunched over to fit in the confines of the space. He slowly turns to face you and your stomach drops.
# His face is gaunt and his skin looks thin and stretched too tight across his skull. Where his eyes should be are dark, empty pits.
# The man opens his mouth, lets out a screech and rushes towards you.
# Without thinking you thrust the knife forwards. Your hand plunges straight through where the man's chest should be. Before you can question why he has passed completely through you.
# When you turn around to look, he's gone. On the floor of the cupboard where the man had been is a key. You pick it up, it seems to be quite old, but it must be used somewhere within the house.
